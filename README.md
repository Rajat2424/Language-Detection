# Language-Detection
This is a language detection model. It is trained on a dataset containing thousands of sentences across multiple languages. By using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm, the model calculates the probability of a text belonging to a specific language based on the frequency of its words and character patterns.

#  Key Features
* **Multi-Language Support:** Detects over 10+ major global languages.
* **High Efficiency:** Uses Naive Bayes for near-instant classification speeds.
* **Vectorization:** Converts raw text into numerical data using `CountVectorizer`.
